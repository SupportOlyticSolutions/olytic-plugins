# Competitive Landscape — Olytic Solutions

Reference this when writing content that needs to differentiate Olytic or address competitive alternatives.

## Competitor Categories

### 1. GTM AI Platform Vendors

| Competitor | What They Do | Olytic Differentiator |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Clari** | AI-powered revenue intelligence — pipeline visibility, forecasting, deal health | SaaS platform you adopt. Olytic builds custom AI architectures into your existing stack. Clari is enterprise-focused; Olytic serves SMBs. |
| **Gong** | Conversation intelligence — analyzes sales calls and meetings | Narrow focus on conversation data. Olytic covers the entire GTM function. Gong requires platform adoption; Olytic works within existing tools. |
| **ZoomInfo / Chorus** | Mega-vendor GTM cloud with conversation intelligence bolt-on | Enterprise mega-vendor. Olytic is independent, SMB-focused, and embedded. |

### 2. Traditional Salesforce Consulting Partners

| Competitor | What They Do | Olytic Differentiator |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Accenture (SF wing)** | Large firm Salesforce implementations with emerging AI advisory | Massive, expensive, project-focused. Olytic is SMB-focused, embedded, outcome-oriented. They implement and leave; Olytic operates long-term. |
| **Boutique SF partners** | Salesforce implementation and optimization, adding AI advisory | Still implementation/advisory focused. Olytic's embedded operations model and closed-loop AI architecture sets us apart. They set up the platform; we drive business outcomes. |

### 3. RevOps Agencies & Consultancies

| Competitor | What They Do | Olytic Differentiator |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Boutique RevOps agencies** | Traditional RevOps consulting modernizing with AI-assisted process optimization | Project-based engagements then hand off. Olytic stays embedded. Most agencies layer AI onto traditional consulting; Olytic builds AI architectures from the ground up. |
| **RevOps-as-a-Service** | Managed RevOps services, outsourced team support | Body-rental or process management. Olytic builds closed-loop AI systems. We require the client to have RevOps capability (we augment, not replace). |

### 4. Fractional CRO / Revenue Leadership

| Competitor | What They Do | Olytic Differentiator |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Fractional CRO firms** | Provide fractional C-suite revenue leadership and strategy | They provide guidance and decision-making. Olytic provides execution — building and operating AI systems. Different value propositions entirely. |

## Positioning One-Liners

Use these when you need a quick competitive contrast:

- "Consultants advise and leave. We build and stay."
- "We're not selling you a tool. We're building the architecture that makes your tools work together."
- "The market has plenty of firms that can recommend AI. We're the ones who build it, configure it, and operate it."
- "Fractional leadership tells you what to do. We do it — and keep doing it."
- "Our engagement doesn't end at go-live. That's where it starts."

## The White Space

The gap Olytic occupies: **embedded, closed-loop AI systems for SMB go-to-market teams.** No one else combines:

- Revenue systems expertise (not generic AI consulting)
- The O/G/O architecture (not off-the-shelf tools)
- Embedded, continuous operation (not project-based)
- SMB focus (not enterprise-only pricing)
- Strategic value creation (not just tactical execution)
