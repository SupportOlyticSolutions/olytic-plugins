# Olytic Solutions — Brand Standards

> **Brand Voice Facet.** Brand standards are one facet of Olytic's governance layer. They translate the company's strategic mission and core values into external-facing communication. If you need broader strategic or values context, also load `olytic-company-strategy`.

These standards apply to ALL external-facing content: website pages, blog posts, emails, proposals, support responses, social posts, presentations, and client deliverables.

## Company Identity

**One-liner:** Olytic Solutions is a revenue systems firm that builds, configures, and operates closed-loop AI architectures for go-to-market teams.

**What we are:** A **systems firm** that stays embedded with clients for continuous refinement.

**What we are NOT:**
- NOT a consulting firm (we don't just advise and leave)
- NOT a SaaS vendor (we don't sell a tool)
- NOT an agency (we don't do project work and hand off)

This distinction matters in every piece of content. If a sentence could describe a consultancy or a SaaS vendor, rewrite it.

**Core Framework — O/G/O (Operator / Governor / Optimizer):**

A three-layer closed-loop architecture:

- **Operator** — drafts content and deliverables
- **Governor** — validates outputs against brand and quality standards
- **Optimizer** — learns from analytics and performance data to feed improvements back into the loop

Humans stay in control at every decision point. The philosophy is **"amplification, not automation."**

This is not "build it once and now you're empowered." The beauty of these AI systems is that the whole thing runs as a closed loop — analysis and recommendations for improvement based on outcomes and changes in the landscape are automatically served up to people. But the human still has agency.

**Three Uniques:**

- Revenue systems and operations expertise
- The Olytic Model (O/G/O framework)
- Strategic value creation

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

- **Company type:** SMB B2B companies with go-to-market teams
- **Internal capability:** Has a RevOps manager or Salesforce admin, but lacks technology strategy capability
- **Mindset:** Knows they need AI but doesn't have a clear point of view on what that means, and lacks the technical chops and technology project experience to make it happen
- **Buying behavior:** Willing to invest in tooling, needs a strategic partner, buys non-time-bound engagements (fixed-fee assessments, retainer models, premium pricing for expertise and perspective)
- **Relationship quality:** Good people you'd happily still be working with after meeting #20

When writing for the ICP, speak to their reality: they're smart operators who are overwhelmed by AI noise. They need clarity and a partner, not another pitch.

## Brand Voice & Writing Style

Olytic's voice is expert, specific, creative, with a dry sense of humor. It can speak corporate fluently but also mocks corporate-speak at the same time.

### Voice Rules

- **Be an expert, not a lecturer.** Show deep knowledge through specificity, not jargon walls. Reference real scenarios, real tradeoffs, real consequences.
- **Be opinionated.** Take positions. Say "we almost always recommend" or "this is not really a worthwhile option to consider at length. Let's move on." Don't hedge everything.
- **Be structured.** Favor bullet points, tables, numbered lists, clear section headers, and tables of contents for longer pieces. Avoid text-heavy paragraphs. Break things up.
- **Be dry.** Humor should be deadpan and understated. Never try to be funny. Just be honest in a way that happens to be amusing. Example tone: "we don't have magic wands and can't promise to help, but at the very least we're a shoulder to cry on."
- **Be practical.** Always ground content in real scenarios, real decisions, real consequences. Avoid abstract thought leadership. Every claim should connect to something the reader can act on.
- **Use "we" generously.** Position Olytic as a team the reader is working alongside, not a vendor talking at them.
- **Mock corporate-speak gently.** Use it when needed, then undercut it. Example: leading with a polished framework name, then immediately explaining it in plain language.
- **Use rhetorical questions to guide the reader.** "So do you really need to adopt this? It's worth stopping to consider."
- **Short punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones.** Vary the rhythm.
- **Bold key terms** for scannability. Readers should be able to skim and still get the point.

### Things to NEVER Do

- Never write fluffy, generic thought leadership ("In today's rapidly evolving landscape...")
- Never use hollow superlatives ("best-in-class", "world-class", "cutting-edge")
- Never write long unbroken paragraphs — break everything into structured, scannable formats
- Never position Olytic as a "consulting firm" or "SaaS vendor"
- Never suggest AI replaces humans — always frame as amplification
- Never be salesy or pushy — let the expertise sell itself
- Never use emojis in professional content

### Messaging Pillars

1. **Systems, not consulting.** We build and operate, we don't just advise.
2. **Amplification, not automation.** Humans stay in control.
3. **Closed-loop architecture.** The O/G/O framework means continuous improvement, not one-time projects.
4. **Embedded partnership.** We're still here at meeting #20.
5. **Revenue outcomes.** Everything connects back to revenue acceleration.

## Competitive Positioning

For the full competitive landscape, see `references/competitive-landscape.md`.

**Key positioning themes:**

- vs. **Traditional consultancies** (Accenture, boutique Salesforce partners): They advise and leave. We stay embedded and operate.
- vs. **SaaS platforms** (Clari, Gong, ZoomInfo): They sell a tool you adopt. We build AI systems into YOUR existing stack.
- vs. **RevOps agencies**: They do project-based work then hand off. We operate continuously.
- vs. **Fractional CRO / RevOps-as-a-service**: They provide leadership or bodies. We build and run AI-powered systems.
- vs. **AI tool vendors**: They sell generic AI. We build closed-loop architectures specific to your GTM motion.

**The gap Olytic fills:** There is no one else building embedded, closed-loop AI systems for SMB GTM teams. Consultants advise. Vendors sell tools. Olytic builds, configures, and operates the architecture.

## Design Preferences

**Typography:**
- **Primary font:** DM Sans — clean, modern, slightly informal without being casual
- **Headings:** DM Sans SemiBold or Bold with appropriate hierarchy (H1 larger, H2 medium, H3 smaller)
- **Body text:** DM Sans Regular, 16–18px on web; 11–12pt in documents
- **Monospace / code:** System monospace for any technical strings

**Color Palette:**
- **Gold / Accent:** `#C8A96E` — use for highlights, key callouts, decorative rule lines, and CTA elements
- **Surface / Background:** `#F7F7F5` — warm off-white; default page and card background
- **Dark / Ink:** Near-black (`#1A1A1A` or equivalent) for body text and primary headings
- **Borders / Dividers:** Light warm grays that complement the surface color; never harsh black borders
- **Avoid:** Bright blues, greens, reds, or other colors that pull attention away from content and Gold accents

**Layout Principles:**
- Clean, structured layouts that mirror the writing style — scannable and organized
- Professional but not corporate-sterile; warmth comes from typography and off-white backgrounds
- Generous whitespace between sections — content should breathe, not be crammed
- Data visualizations, diagrams, and structured tables preferred over stock photography
- Tables and structured comparisons over prose wherever possible

**Content Design:**
- Bold key terms inline for scannability — readers skim first, then dive
- Section headers should be substantive, not generic: not "Introduction" but "Why Most AI Projects Fail"
- Gold accent used sparingly: one or two highlights per page, not every other heading
- No gradients, heavy drop shadows, or skeuomorphic effects — flat and structured
- Icons and visual markers welcome when they aid navigation; decorative imagery is low priority
