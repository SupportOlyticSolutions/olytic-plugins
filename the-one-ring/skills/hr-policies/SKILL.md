# Olytic Solutions — HR & People Policies

> **People Consistency Facet.** HR policies are how Olytic's core values show up in how we operate day-to-day. They exist to ensure consistent, predictable, fair treatment of everyone on the team — and to reinforce the working culture that makes us effective partners to our clients.

*Note: Olytic is an early-stage company. Some policies below reflect working defaults that may be updated as the company matures. When in doubt about a specific situation, escalate to company leadership rather than guessing.*

## Culture Principles

These reflect how Olytic operates, informed by our brand voice and core values:

- **Expertise over activity.** We value sharp thinking and quality output, not hours logged.
- **Ownership over tasks.** Own outcomes, not just deliverables.
- **Directness over diplomacy.** Say what you mean. Be kind, but don't hide behind corporate hedging.
- **Continuous improvement.** The O/G/O framework isn't just for clients — we apply closed-loop thinking to how we work too.

## Communication Norms

- **Default to async.** Write things down rather than scheduling meetings. If a meeting can be a message, make it a message.
- **Be structured.** Internal communication should follow the same principles as our external voice — bullets, headers, clear conclusions. No walls of text.
- **Respond within 24 hours** during business days for internal messages that require a response.
- **Meetings need agendas.** No agenda, no meeting. If you're scheduling a meeting, include what you need people to come prepared for.
- **Document decisions.** When something is decided, write it down where the team can find it. Don't let important decisions live only in someone's memory.

## Work Hours & Flexibility

- **Fully remote.** Olytic has no physical office requirement.
- **Async-first.** No mandated core hours — but you're expected to be responsive during the business hours relevant to your role and any active client engagements.
- **Client-facing work:** When clients are involved, your availability should align with theirs. Communicate proactively if your schedule changes.
- **Flexible scheduling:** Manage your own schedule. What matters is outputs and responsiveness, not clock time.

## Time Off

- **PTO policy:** Flexible and unlimited. Take what you need — but communicate ahead of time, especially for anything more than a day.
- **Sick leave:** Take it when you need it. Don't push through illness. Notify leadership if you'll be unavailable for more than a day.
- **Holidays:** US federal holidays are observed. Additionally, take your regional or cultural holidays as relevant — just give advance notice.
- **Request process:** Notify company leadership in advance. For planned time off of 3+ days, give at least 2 weeks' notice where possible.
- **Blackout periods:** During critical client deliverable deadlines or launch windows, time off may need to be coordinated — leadership will communicate this in advance.

## Onboarding

New team members should complete the following in their first week:

1. **Access setup:** Get access to all relevant GitHub repos, shared tools, and communication channels
2. **Plugin installation:** Install The One Ring plugin and any role-specific plugins
3. **Strategy & values:** Read the `olytic-company-strategy` skill — understand what we're doing and why
4. **Brand standards:** Read `olytic-brand-standards` — understand how we communicate externally
5. **Security policies:** Read `olytic-security-policies` — understand data handling rules before touching any client systems
6. **First conversation:** Have an onboarding call with leadership to align on your role, priorities, and how you'll work together
7. **First 30 days:** Focus on understanding existing work, patterns, and systems before proposing major changes

## Professional Development

- **Learning is expected.** This is a fast-moving space. Staying current with AI, revenue systems, and GTM strategy is part of the job.
- **Time for learning:** There is no formal learning hours policy — build it into your work cadence. If something you're learning is directly relevant to current work, that's billable time.
- **Budget:** Professional development budget exists — discuss specific requests with company leadership. Priority goes to learning that serves current strategic priorities.
- **Sharing knowledge:** When you learn something relevant to the team, write it up and share it. This is how we get smarter as a firm.

## Escalation

When in doubt about any people-related question — scheduling, conflicts, scope, expectations, compensation — ask company leadership directly rather than guessing or making assumptions.

If you're unsure whether something rises to the level of an escalation, err on the side of raising it. Better to surface a non-issue than to let a real issue fester.
