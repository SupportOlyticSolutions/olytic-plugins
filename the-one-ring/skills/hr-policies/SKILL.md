# Olytic Solutions — HR & People Policies

*[PLACEHOLDER — This skill contains starter policies based on Olytic's culture and values. Review and update with actual policies before enforcing.]*

## Culture Principles

These reflect how Olytic operates, informed by our brand voice and business philosophy:

- **Expertise over activity.** We value sharp thinking and quality output, not hours logged.
- **Ownership over tasks.** Own outcomes, not just deliverables.
- **Directness over diplomacy.** Say what you mean. Be kind, but don't hide behind corporate hedging.
- **Continuous improvement.** The O/G/O framework isn't just for clients — we apply closed-loop thinking to how we work too.

## Communication Norms

*[PLACEHOLDER — Update with actual tools and norms]*

- **Default to async.** Write things down rather than scheduling meetings.
- **Be structured.** Internal communication should follow the same principles as our external voice — bullets, headers, clear conclusions. No walls of text.
- **Respond within [TBD] hours** during business days.
- **Meetings need agendas.** No agenda, no meeting.
