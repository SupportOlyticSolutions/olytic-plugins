## Vision

Olytic is an **AI implementation and optimization platform** built on a simple observation: every company using AI tools has the same problem — the AI is only as good as the day it was set up. Olytic fixes that.

We build a self-improving layer on top of existing AI plugins. Every week, the Optimizer pulls analytics, CRM data, and competitive intelligence — and automatically surfaces strategic updates to the plugin and a prioritized content brief queue. The plugin gets smarter every Monday without anyone having to think about it.

Across all clients, Olytic is building a cross-company behavioral dataset that doesn't exist anywhere else — which we monetize as intelligence. Our competitors get commoditized. We get compounding.

**The 90-second pitch:** Every company using AI tools has the same problem: the AI is only as good as the day it was set up. Olytic fixes that. We build a self-improving layer on top of your existing AI plugins. Every week, our Optimizer pulls your analytics, your CRM data, your competitors' moves — and automatically surfaces strategic updates to the plugin and a prioritized content brief queue. The plugin gets smarter every Monday without anyone having to think about it. And across all our clients, we're building a dataset that doesn't exist anywhere else — which we monetize as intelligence.

## Philosophy

**"Amplification, not automation"** is not a tagline. It's an architectural principle. We aren't trying to replace humans with automation — we empower them through a closed loop: analysis and recommendations for improvement, based on outcomes and changes in the landscape, are automatically served up to people. But the human still gets to have agency.

The **O/G/O framework** (Operator / Governor / Optimizer) is how this philosophy becomes a system.

---

## Core Values

These values govern how Olytic operates internally and how we show up for clients. They are not aspirational — they describe how we actually work.

- **Clarity over noise.** We cut through complexity. If we can't explain something simply, we don't understand it yet. Every deliverable should make things clearer, not add to the fog.
- **Embedded partnership.** We're not vendors. We don't advise and leave. We're still here at meeting #20, and that changes how we work.
- **Amplification, not automation.** AI serves people, not the reverse. Humans stay in control at every decision point. We build systems that make people sharper — not systems that replace them.
- **Systems thinking.** We build loops, not one-offs. Every engagement has a feedback mechanism. Every recommendation connects to an outcome. We don't hand off and walk away.
- **Earned expertise.** We earn the right to be opinionated by doing the work. We take positions because we've thought them through — not because we're performing confidence.

## Current Business Stage

Olytic Solutions is in **pre-launch go-to-market**. Claude Cowork went enterprise-grade on February 24, 2026. We are targeting our **first implementation clients starting July 2026**, building proof-of-concept case studies and establishing our position as a recognized Cowork implementation specialist.

**The window matters.** Being a recognized Cowork implementation specialist in 2026 is the equivalent of being a Salesforce partner in 2005. The window to establish that position is open right now and won't stay open long.

**Next tangible goals:**
1. Win the first 3 implementation clients at the case study rate ($10K)
2. Deliver case studies that prove the model
3. Convert implementations to Claude OS Care managed service retainers
4. Reach 15 managed clients (Threshold 1) by late 2028

## The Two Products

### Product 1 — Claude OS Implementation

A **fixed-fee, phased implementation engagement** that installs a functioning AI operating system inside the client's organization. Three phases over 6–8 weeks:

| Phase | Weeks | What Happens | Deliverable |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Discovery & Strategy | 1–2 | Map workflows, identify 3–5 highest-value use cases, interview users, design plugin architecture | Deployment plan and plugin specifications |
| Build & Configure | 3–5 | Build plugins, prompt engineering, testing and iteration, management page setup | 3 working plugins + management interface |
| Activation & Training | 6–8 | Team rollout, training sessions, early feedback, tuning, documentation handover | Trained team + documented system |

**Pricing:**
- Standard (20–60 person company): **$15,000** — 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
- Complex (60–100 person company): **$25,000** — 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
- First 3 clients (case study rate): **$10,000** — 50% upfront, 50% on delivery

### Product 2 — Claude OS Care (Managed Service)

A **12-month managed service retainer** that keeps the client's AI OS current, improving, and aligned with their evolving business. This is not a support contract — it's an ongoing strategic relationship.

**What's included:**
- Quarterly plugin audit and refresh — prompts updated, new capabilities added based on real usage patterns
- New plugin builds for emerging use cases — 1–2 per quarter included in retainer
- Access to the Optimizer's weekly analysis — competitive intelligence, performance data, content brief queue
- Ongoing AI strategy advisory — guidance on new tools, workflows, and AI investment decisions
- Priority access to new Olytic platform capabilities as they're released
- Quarterly benchmarking report — how the client compares to peers (unlocks at 15 managed clients)

**Pricing: $2,000–$2,500/month** on a 12-month commitment. Rises to $2,500 when benchmark data unlocks at 15 managed clients.

**Pricing principle:** Price signals quality. If a prospect pushes back on $25K for an implementation that will save them 10–20 hours/week per knowledge worker, that's a signal about fit, not price. Do not discount to win — discount to get the case study, then return to full price immediately.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

We are **deliberately avoiding large enterprises** in the early phase — not because they're not valuable, but because they have procurement departments, IT security reviews, and 6-month sales cycles that would kill our momentum.

| Dimension | Target Profile | Avoid |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Company size | 20–100 employees | Under 10 (no budget), over 200 (too slow) |
| Industry | Marketing/PR agencies, consulting firms, recruiting, financial advisory, specialty e-commerce | Manufacturing, regulated industries (healthcare, finance) without clear AI mandate |
| AI maturity | Disappointed early adopter — tried ChatGPT, got nothing, believes in AI but frustrated | Skeptics who need convincing AI works at all |
| Decision-maker | Founder or COO who can say yes over lunch | Any company that mentions "we'd need to run this by legal" |
| Content/ops intensity | Knowledge-work heavy — lots of content, client deliverables, or repeatable internal processes | Companies whose core value is physical or highly specialized technical work |

**Priority industries:** Marketing and PR agencies are ideal — they feel competitive AI pressure most acutely, the ROI of a content plugin is immediate, and founders in this space make fast decisions. Professional services firms are second.

## The Market Opportunity

Claude Cowork launched enterprise-grade on February 24, 2026. Anthropic's own framing: "2025 was the year Claude transformed how developers work — 2026 is the same year for knowledge workers." This is the identical wave that created an entire ecosystem of implementation consultants around Salesforce, HubSpot, and more recently Claude Code.

**Why Olytic wins early:**
- We've already done it for ourselves — built three internal Claude plugins and a management interface before selling anything
- We have consulting DNA — strategy, discovery, change management, and stakeholder communication are skills most AI vendors don't have
- We have proprietary technology — the Optimizer is a weekly AI agent that analyzes plugin performance, researches competitive landscape, and surfaces recommendations; a freelance AI consultant can't replicate this
- We're building a data asset competitors can't buy — every client engagement generates anonymized behavioral data on how SMBs adopt and use AI plugins

## Strategic Priorities

| Priority | Description | Milestone |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Case study acquisition | Win first 3 clients at $10K to build proof points | July–Dec 2026 |
| Managed service conversion | Convert implementations to Claude OS Care retainers | Ongoing; 60% target conversion rate |
| Threshold 1: 15 managed clients | Cross-client patterns emerge; benchmark data justifies $2,500/mo | Late 2028 |
| Threshold 2: 30 managed clients | Launch 'State of SMB AI Adoption' annual report at $5K/yr subscription | Mid-2029 |
| Threshold 3: 50 managed clients | Full data licensing to PE firms, MarTech platforms at $35K average | 2029–2030 |
| Optimizer platform build | Develop and productize the weekly AI analysis engine | Parallel to managed service growth |

---

## Long-Term Vision: The Optimizer Platform

The Optimizer is the technology layer that separates Olytic from any freelance consultant. It's a weekly AI agent that runs against each client's data and makes their plugin smarter every Monday — automatically.

**Data sources the Optimizer analyzes:**
- Google Analytics 4 — page performance, engagement, conversions → identifies which content formats drive traffic
- Google Search Console — keyword rankings, CTR, impressions → surfaces keyword opportunities and positioning gaps
- CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce) — lead-to-opportunity rates, content attribution → connects content strategy to pipeline and revenue
- Competitive intelligence — web search for competitor content, positioning shifts → flags competitive moves and repositioning opportunities
- Plugin usage logs — how the marketer uses the plugin, what they override → identifies where the plugin is misaligned with real usage

**Output:** Two recommendation tracks — **Plugin Updates** (strategic changes to the plugin itself, sent to the client stakeholder for approval) and **Creator Briefs** (tactical content briefs for the marketing team, delivered as a prioritized queue every Monday morning).

---

## Long-Term Vision: The Data Intelligence Business

As Olytic manages plugins across multiple clients and industries, it accumulates something no individual client has — a cross-company behavioral dataset showing how SMBs actually adopt and use AI tools. Anonymized and aggregated, this becomes a standalone commercial product.

**Revenue thresholds:**
- **15 managed clients** → Internal use only. Benchmark data justifies raising retainer to $2,500/month.
- **30 managed clients** → First external product: 'State of SMB AI Adoption' annual report. Sold at $5K/yr to marketing leaders and agencies. ~$60K/year revenue.
- **50 managed clients** → Full data licensing to PE firms, strategic acquirers, MarTech platforms. 7 licenses at $35K average = $245K/year in near-pure-margin revenue.

The data asset is built for free as a byproduct of running the managed service — zero marginal cost to collect. Significant commercial value once scale is reached.

## How This Informs Work

When producing any work product, consider:

- **Does this serve the current phase?** Right now, that means winning case study clients and building proof points. Generic content or long-horizon thinking doesn't help right now unless it directly supports near-term acquisition.
- **Does this demonstrate that we've done it ourselves?** The biggest differentiator is proof. We built our own plugins before selling to anyone. Surface this wherever possible.
- **Does this differentiate from freelance AI consultants?** Anyone can consult. The Optimizer and the data asset are what make us defensible. Keep that visible.
- **Is this consistent with the Claude Cowork partner angle?** Position as THE implementation specialist for Cowork, not a generic AI consultant.
- **Does this reflect our values?** Clarity, partnership, amplification, systems thinking, earned expertise — these should be visible in the work.
