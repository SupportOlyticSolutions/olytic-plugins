Review the provided content against Olytic Solutions' brand standards.

Steps:
1. Load the `olytic-brand-standards` skill for reference
2. Read the content from `$ARGUMENTS` (file path) or use the content pasted by the user
3. Evaluate against each of these dimensions:

**Voice & Tone Compliance:**
- Expert and specific (not generic)?
- Structured format (bullets, tables, headers vs. text walls)?
- Dry humor present where appropriate?
- Uses "we" positioning?
- Opinionated — takes clear positions?
- Free of hollow superlatives and fluffy language?

**Messaging Compliance:**
- Positions Olytic as a systems firm (not consulting, not SaaS)?
- Frames AI as amplification, not automation?
- References relevant Olytic uniques where appropriate?
- Speaks to ICP pain points in their language?

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Differentiates clearly from consultancies, SaaS vendors, RevOps agencies?
- Avoids language that could apply to any competitor?

**Structural Compliance:**
- Scannable with bold terms, bullet points, tables?
- No paragraphs longer than 3 sentences?
- Clear section headers?
- Appropriate CTA (subtle, not salesy)?

4. Present findings as a scorecard:

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Voice & Tone | Pass/Needs Work | [specific feedback] |
| Messaging | Pass/Needs Work | [specific feedback] |
| Competitive Positioning | Pass/Needs Work | [specific feedback] |
| Structure | Pass/Needs Work | [specific feedback] |

5. For any "Needs Work" items, provide specific rewrites or suggestions.
