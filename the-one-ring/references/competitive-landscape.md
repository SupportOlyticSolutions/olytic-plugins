# Olytic Solutions — Competitive Landscape

*This reference supports the `olytic-brand-standards` skill. Load brand-standards first; this file provides expanded competitive context for positioning decisions.*

## The Category Gap

There is no established category for what Olytic does. The closest analogs are:

- Management consultancies (but they advise and leave)
- SaaS platforms (but they sell a tool you configure yourself)
- RevOps agencies (but they do project work and hand off)
- Fractional RevOps / CRO services (but they provide a person, not a system)
- AI tool vendors (but they sell generic AI capabilities)

Olytic sits in the white space between all of these: we build and operate embedded, closed-loop AI systems for GTM teams. That's the positioning to defend in every piece of content.

## Competitor Profiles

### Traditional Consultancies

**Examples:** Accenture, boutique Salesforce partners, RevOps advisory firms

**Their pitch:** Strategic advice and expertise, delivered through project engagements.

**Their gap:** They advise and leave. The strategy deck doesn't run itself. When the engagement ends, the client is on their own.

**Olytic's counter:** We build systems that run. We stay embedded. The engagement doesn't end — it evolves.

### SaaS Platforms

**Examples:** Clari, Gong, ZoomInfo, Outreach, Salesloft

**Their pitch:** A powerful tool that, once adopted, improves your GTM performance.

**Their gap:** The tool is generic. Adoption requires internal capability to configure, integrate, and interpret. Most SMBs lack this. Tools don't come with a Governor or Optimizer — humans have to do that work manually.

**Olytic's counter:** We build AI systems into YOUR existing stack. We're not selling you another tool to manage — we're building the architecture that makes your existing tools work as a coherent system.

---

### RevOps Agencies

**Examples:** Boutique RevOps shops, implementation partners

**Their pitch:** We'll fix your RevOps function — build your tech stack, clean your data, configure your CRM.

**Their gap:** Project-based. They hand off. After delivery, the client owns maintenance and refinement — which requires internal capability they probably don't have.

**Olytic's counter:** We operate continuously. We're not done when the CRM is configured — we're done when the system is producing better revenue outcomes. Which it never stops doing.

---

### Fractional CRO / RevOps-as-a-Service

**Examples:** Revenue leadership fractional providers, RevOps-as-a-service firms

**Their pitch:** Get senior revenue leadership or execution capacity without a full-time hire.

**Their gap:** They provide leadership or bodies. A fractional CRO sets strategy. A RevOps hire executes tasks. Neither builds a self-improving AI system.

**Olytic's counter:** We build and run AI-powered systems. The value isn't a person-hour — it's a closed-loop architecture that gets smarter over time.

---

### AI Tool Vendors

**Examples:** Copy.ai, Apollo.io AI features, Salesforce Einstein, HubSpot AI

**Their pitch:** AI capabilities built into the tools you already use, or standalone AI tools for specific GTM tasks.

**Their gap:** Generic AI applied generically. No architectural thinking. No closed-loop. No one operating the system.

**Olytic's counter:** We build architectures specific to your GTM motion. The AI is configured to your data, your ICP, your sales process, your content — and operated continuously by a team that understands revenue systems.

## Messaging Dos and Don'ts

**When writing about competitors:**

- **DO:** Acknowledge what they do well before explaining why Olytic is different
- **DO:** Position the gap as a category problem ("there's no one doing X"), not a competitor flaw
- **DO:** Use specifics — name the category, name the gap, name the solution
- **DO:** Frame it from the client's perspective ("you're left on your own after the engagement ends")

- **DON'T:** Name specific product competitors (Clari, Gong, etc.) in external content without careful framing
- **DON'T:** Trash competitors — it reads as defensive and signals insecurity
- **DON'T:** Let the comparison become a feature list — this is a positioning conversation, not a spec sheet
- **DON'T:** Imply that the competition is incompetent — the gap is structural, not about talent
