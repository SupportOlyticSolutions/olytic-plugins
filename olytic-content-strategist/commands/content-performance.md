Analyze content performance for Olytic Solutions using GA4 analytics data.

**GA4 Property ID:** 525690219

Steps:
1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is a specific page path, analyze that page's performance
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` is "overview" or empty, provide a high-level content performance summary
3. Connect findings back to the three strategic purposes:
   - **Credibility:** Is this content building trust with the ICP?
   - **Visibility:** Is this content being found through search?
   - **Conversion:** Is this content driving conversations?

4. Present findings in a structured report:

## Content Performance Report

### Traffic Summary
| Page | Sessions | Avg. Engagement Time | Bounce Rate |
|------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| [page] | [number] | [time] | [rate] |

### Key Insights
- [What's working and why]
- [What's underperforming and why]
- [Opportunities based on search queries]

### Recommendations
| Action | Page | Rationale | Priority |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| [Create/Update/Optimize] | [page] | [why] | [High/Medium/Low] |

5. Always tie recommendations back to the content strategy framework (content pillars, ICP journey stage, differentiation potential).
